This note contains some references, experiences and opinions on the frameworks.

:::note[Frameworks?]
The frameworks here refer to the programs/platforms on Wayland that provide "bar" thingy, but not limited to bars.
Simple "bar" program will still be called a "Framework" here, despite it's actually not.

:::caution[Clarification]
This note may contain personal subjective opinions, although objectivity is not excluded, it is still difficult to guarantee.
Some contents come from personal experiences, so it is difficult to guarantee topicality and correctness.
However, feel free to discuss it [here](https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland-wiki/discussions).
