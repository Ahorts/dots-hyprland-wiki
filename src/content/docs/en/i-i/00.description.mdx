  - fish
  - foot
  - fuzzel
  - gtklock
  - Hyprland
  - mpv
  - hyprlock
  - wlogout
  - qt5ct

- Why [AGS](https://github.com/Aylur/ags/) and not [EWW](https://github.com/elkowar/eww)? Simply put, it's more capable and is more performant. Cool possible stuff include:
  - We have swipe-to-dismiss notifications
  - Drag and drop support
