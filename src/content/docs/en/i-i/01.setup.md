# Installing
## Before you start
1. This only provides user-level customization. You have to set up network, bluetooth, nvidia stuff, etc. yourself
2. EndeavourOS GNOME is recommended to save you some hassle. (Other Arch distros are fine, though)
3. If you only have 8GiB of RAM, you might wanna [set up zram](https://forum.endeavouros.com/t/enabling-zram-in-endeavouros/37746) (or swap), since compiling Hyprland takes quite a bit of resources.

## Automated installation (for Arch distros only)
- _**This is the recommended method**_

Just run the following command, and it will clone the repo to `~/.cache/dots-hyprland` by default.
```bash
bash <(curl -s "https://end-4.github.io/dots-hyprland-wiki/setup.sh")
```
You may specify a path in place of `~/.cache/dots-hyprland`, e.g.
```bash
bash <(curl -s "https://end-4.github.io/dots-hyprland-wiki/setup.sh") ~/.dots/dots-hyprland
```

:::note[Alternative method]
Or, alternatively, clone the repo and run the install script:
```bash
t=~/.cache/dots-hyprland   # Let's not trash your home folder
git clone https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland.git "$t" --filter=blob:none
cd "$t"
./install.sh
```
:::

:::tip[Tip]
The script `install.sh` is idempotent and interactive. 
You can run it multiple times and choose to only perform certain actions.
:::

## NixOS
- Currently, these dotfiles are not (yet?) offered as a flake. 
- Though you can check out [end_4's NixOS flake](https://github.com/end-4/CirnOS)
  - It includes home-manager config. You wanna check the `homes` folder.

## Manual installation (basically any distro)
:::caution[Warning]
This repo is maintained for Arch Linux.
If your distro isn't Arch(-based), you'll have to figure out the equivalents of packages inside `scriptdata/dependencies.conf`.
:::

- Clone and go to directory
  ```bash
  t=~/.cache/dots-hyprland   # Let's not trash your home folder
  git clone https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland.git "$t" --filter=blob:none
  cd "$t"
  ```
- Get packages: Install all packages listed inside `scriptdata/dependencies.conf`. For Arch Linux, just use an AUR helper such as `yay`.

- Add user to `video` and `input` group
  ```bash
  sudo usermod -aG video,input "$(whoami)" # if this somehow doesn't work, just replace "$(whoami)" with your username
  ```
- Install AGS **FROM SOURCE** (the AUR package is not up-to-date): just run `./update-ags.sh`.
- Copy `.config`, `.local` to your home folder (review before doing this or you might have your own config files undesirably overwritten)

- Get started with these keybinds
  - Press `Ctrl`+`Super`+`T` and select a picture for wallpaper
  - Press `Super`+`/` for a list of keybinds. Have fun!


- Optional
  - See if you're interested in anything in the `Import manually` folder
  - If you want media thumbnail from your browser to be shown, get the "Plasma browser integration" extension
    - For [Chromium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/plasma-integration/cimiefiiaegbelhefglklhhakcgmhkai)
    - For [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/plasma-integration/)

# Updating
## Automatically installed
Run `git pull` under the git repo to get the latest update.

Run `./install.sh` again, and skip the steps which you don't want (especially the `rsync ...` ones because it will **override your files under its target path**).

To only update AGS, simply run `./update-ags.sh`.
## Manually installed
Run `git pull` under the git repo to get the latest update.

Then grab things manually, similar to manual installation.

To only update AGS, simply run `./update-ags.sh`.

# Uninstalling
- Manual uninstallation is **heavily recommended**
- Currently, there's a script for uninstallation, but it's far from perfect and is not actively maintained.

> The point is that this repo is not a typical "software", but a set of config,
> Therefore it's very hard to make a proper uninstallation script,
> which should revert all changes made by the installation script.
> 
> For example, the installation script will install `yay` (AUR-helper) for you if you don't have one.
> However, what should the uninstallation script do to revert this changes?
> - Remove `yay` or `yay-bin`? Not proper, because you may already have one of them installed by yourself (NOT by the installation script).
> - Even if the installation script had logged the package list installed by the script, it's still not proper to remove `yay` or `yay-bin` when the log showed `yay` or `yay-bin` is installed by the script, because the script can't log its future, and you may have reinstalled `yay` or `yay-bin` another day after the installation script finished, thus they are actually not installed by installation script anymore.
> 
> In conclusion, it's nearly not possible to write a proper uninstallation script.
> You'd better make reverted changes manually as you need.
