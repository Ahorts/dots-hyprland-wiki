# Installation
## NOTEs
1. Below process only provides user-level customization and is NOT a complete solution for a fresh install. You have to set up network, bluetooth, nvidia stuff, etc. yourself
2. The author personally use (and highly recommend) EndeavourOS GNOME to not have to deal with all that hassle. Though you can use regular Arch just fine. It's never necessary to reinstall your system for this!
3. If your distro isn't Arch(-based), you'll have to figure out the equivalents of packages below.
4. If you only have 8GiB of RAM, you might wanna [set up zram](https://forum.endeavouros.com/t/enabling-zram-in-endeavouros/37746) (or swap) before starting the installation, since compiling Hyprland takes quite a bit of resources.

## Automated installation (Arch distros only; Recommended)
Clone, checkout this branch, then run install script:
```bash
cd ~/Downloads   # Let's not trash your home folder
git clone https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland.git
cd dots-hyprland && git checkout illogical-impulse
./install.sh
```

This script is idempotent, which means that you can run it multiple times.

## Manual installation
- Clone and checkout this branch
  ```bash
  cd ~/Downloads   # Let's not trash your home folder
  git clone https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland.git
  cd dots-hyprland && git checkout illogical-impulse
  ```
- Get packages: Install all packages listed inside `scriptdata/dependencies.conf` using AUR helper such as `yay`.
- Add user to `video` and `input` group
  ```bash
  sudo usermod -aG video,input "$(whoami)" # if this somehow doesn't work, just replace "$(whoami)" with your username
  ```
- Install AGS **FROM SOURCE** (the AUR package is NOT up-to-date): just run `./update-ags.sh`.
- Copy `.config`, `.local` to your home folder (review before doing this or you might have your own config files undesirably overwritten)
- Get started with these keybinds
  - Press `Ctrl`+`Super`+`T` and select a picture for wallpaper
  - Press `Super`+`/` for a list of keybinds. Have fun!

- Optional
  - See if you're interested in anything in the `Import manually` folder
  - If you want media thumbnail from your browser to be shown, get the "Plasma browser integration" extension
    - For [Chromium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/plasma-integration/cimiefiiaegbelhefglklhhakcgmhkai)
    - For [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/plasma-integration/)

# Update
## Automatically installed
Run `./install.sh` again, and skip the steps which you do NOT want (especially the `rsync ...` ones because it will **override your files under its target path**).

To only update AGS, simply run `./update-ags.sh`.
## Manually installed
Run `git pull` under the git repo to get the latest update.

Then grab things manually, similar to manual installation.

To only update AGS, simply run `./update-ags.sh`.

# Uninstallation
Currently, there's a script for uninstallation, but it's far from perfect and is not actively maintained.

> The point is that this repo is not a typical "software", but a set of config,
> Therefore it's very hard to make a proper uninstallation script,
> which should revert all changes made by the installation script.
> 
> For example, the installation script will install `yay` (AUR-helper) for you if you don't have one.
> However, what should the uninstallation script do to revert this changes?
> - Remove `yay` or `yay-bin`? Not proper, because you may already have one of them installed by yourself (NOT by the installation script).
> - Even if the installation script had logged the package list installed by the script, it's still not proper to remove `yay` or `yay-bin` when the log showed `yay` or `yay-bin` is installed by the script, because you may have other programs using `yay` and this removal will break their functions.
> 
> In conclusion, it's nearly not possible to write a proper uninstallation script.
> You'd better make reverted changes manually as you need.
