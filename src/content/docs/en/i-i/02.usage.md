# Misc
## How to resize | set resolution | font size
Reference: <https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland/issues/180#issuecomment-1880385893>

You can use gsettings to change the font size, like this:
```bash
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface font-name 'Rubik 9'
```
Rubik here is the font name and 9 is the font size in pt (1pt = 1.3333 px)

Stuff should scale according to the font size. Some ags element may need a restart of ags to take effect.

If some elements are wayy too big, then it's possible that css totally not working, see <https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland/issues/226>.

## How to change time format
Reference: <https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland/issues/228>

**NOTE**: You may need to run `man date` for time format.

For AGS bar (it's not a dock bar I guess), you should edit `~/.config/ags/widgets/bar/system.js`.
Find `"%H:%M"` there and change it to what you like.
Its format may refer to [this page](https://docs.gtk.org/glib/method.DateTime.format.html).

The lockscreen is swaylock currently. Edit its config in `~/.config/swaylock/config` to suit your needs.
For time format you need to adjust `timestr`.

## How to set city for weather
Reference: <https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland/issues/220#issuecomment-1923793627>
<https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland/commit/c2d3c5bce37dd87f19bf5e13002b2af6e0e1e5eb>

The value will be used as `${city}` for `curl https://wttr.in/${city}?format=j1`.

By default the value comes from `curl ipinfo.io`.
You can also manually set the value by setting the env var `$AGS_WEATHER_CITY`.
