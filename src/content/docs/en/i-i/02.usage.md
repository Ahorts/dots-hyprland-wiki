# Configure Hyprland
To configure Hyprland, edit the config files of Hyprland which locate under `~/.config/hypr/`.

:::note
`hyprland.conf` is actually the only file that Hyprland will automatically load.

The rest files are also loaded, but only because they are "sourced" in `hyprland.conf`.

E.g. the one to load `execs.conf` is written as `source=~/.config/hypr/execs.conf`.
:::

You may look into and edit those files by yourself and use [Hyprland Wiki](https://wiki.hyprland.org/) as main reference.

:::caution
Generally the lines in the config is loaded in sequence, the ones loaded later will override the ones loaded earlier.

For example, please pay attention to the `rules.conf`, as it may unexpectedly override your configuration, e.g. [#259](https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland/issues/259).
