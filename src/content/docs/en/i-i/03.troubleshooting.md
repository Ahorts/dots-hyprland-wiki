# Hints

- If there's a problem with something, the first thing to do is to fire up a terminal (`Super`+`T`) and run it. Look for errors/warnings that could be problematic.
- The bar, sidebars, cheatsheet, etc. are powered by AGS. Open a terminal and run `pkill ags; ags`

> Use some common sense. If you can't figure out, [open a discussion](https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland/discussions) for help.

## Music controls doesn't show up?

- Make sure your player has Mpris support (a list: [Arch Wiki link](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/MPRIS))
- If it's a browser, install the Plasma Integration extension: [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/plasma-integration/) or [Chromium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/plasma-integration/cimiefiiaegbelhefglklhhakcgmhkai) and `plasma-browser-integration` (this is for Arch)

Then, when firefox is playing media, the following command
```bash
dbus-send --print-reply --dest=org.freedesktop.DBus /org/freedesktop/DBus org.freedesktop.DBus.ListNames|grep mpris
```
the output should include
```plain
string "org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.plasma-browser-integration"
```
Only "plasma-browser-integration" names will work. others won't.

If for some reason, firefox still does not have dbus `org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.plasma-browser-integration` showing up,
consider the following steps:
1. Create a new profile using `firefox --ProfileManager`.
2. Launch firefox with the newprofile and install the Plasma Integration extension again.
3. Restart firefox with the new profile and try again.
- _Note: `playerctl -F metadata` may also be helpful for debugging._
## Firefox crashes when opening certain web page
- With many limitations, you can try to run it in XWayland with the following command:
```bash
env MOZ_ENABLE_WAYLAND=0 firefox
```
- If this solves your problem, you may also find the problem disappears for firefox under wayland some other day (kinda weird, right?).
Therefore, you may copy the original desktop file `/usr/share/applications/firefox.desktop` to `~/.local/share/applications/xfirefox.desktop` and edit as `Name=X Firefox` and `Exec=env MOZ_ENABLE_WAYLAND=0 /usr/lib/firefox/firefox %u`, so that you can use firefox under xwayland when the problem appears again, and normally use firefox under wayland when no problem appears.

## AGS installation failed
### `PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/usr/local/lib/libgvc.so'`
Run this to check whether this file belongs to any package (very likely not, because it's inside `/usr/local`)
```bash
pacman -Qo /usr/local/lib/libgvc.so
```
If not, then it's probably safe to just remove it. To do so, run this:
```bash
sudo mv /usr/local/lib/libgvc.so /tmp/
```
### Other errors
Delete `./cache/ags` and install it again.

## `loginctl lock-session` does nothing

According to [this post on Arch Linux Forums](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1311990#p1311990):
> Something needs to listen to systemd-logind's dbus signals for this to work.

Hypridle is capable to be this "thing", which means you should ensure that it is running,
and then `loginctl lock-session` will send signal to hypridle,
as a result hypridle will lock the screen by executing the `$lock_cmd` defined in its config `~/.config/hypr/hypridle.conf`.

See [Hyprland Wiki](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Hypr-Ecosystem/hypridle/#configuration) for more.
