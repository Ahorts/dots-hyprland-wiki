# Hints

The bar, and the side bars, cheatsheet, etc. belongs to AGS.

To restart AGS and see its debug info, you may need to run this in terminal (by default press `Super+T` to open one):
```bash
pkill ags;ags
```
And see if there're any errors, CRITICALs and WARNINGs.

> Use some common sense. If you can't figure out, open an issue/discussion for help.

# Troubleshooting list

## The player panel does not pop up when there is media playing
> Reference: [end-4/dots-hyprland#168](https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland/issues/168)

Your player must have mpris support (see supported client [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/MPRIS)).

If you are using firefox as player, Plasma Integration extension should be installed and enabled for firefox, and the package `plasma-browser-integration` should be installed on Arch Linux.

Then, when firefox is playing media, the following command:
```bash
dbus-send --print-reply --dest=org.freedesktop.DBus /org/freedesktop/DBus org.freedesktop.DBus.ListNames|grep mpris
```
should at least return
```plain
string "org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.plasma-browser-integration"
```
note that output like `string "org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.firefox.instance_1_37"` does NOT work.

If for some reason, firefox still does not have dbus `org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.plasma-browser-integration` showing up,
consider the following steps:
1. Create a new profile using `firefox --ProfileManager`.
2. Launch firefox with the newprofile and install the Plasma Integration extension again.
3. Restart firefox with the new profile and try again.

Note: `playerctl -F metadata` may also be helpful for debugging.
## Firefox sometimes crashes
When this happens, please use `(xWayland) Firefox`, which desktop file is provided in `~/.local/share/applications` with `env MOZ_ENABLE_WAYLAND=0` for `Exec` entry.

This is just a workround, which makes Firefox running under xWayland.

## ags installation failed
### `PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/usr/local/lib/libgvc.so'`
Run:
```bash
pacman -Qo /usr/local/lib/libgvc.so
```
to check whether this file belongs to any package (very likely not, because it's inside `/usr/local`).

If not, then it's probably safe to just remove it. If you're sure about that, run this:
```bash
sudo mv /usr/local/lib/libgvc.so /tmp/
```
### Other errors
Delete `./cache/ags` and install it again.
