# Installation script

## Idempotent
The script is and should be **idempotent**, which means that user can run this script for multiple times.

This is useful for debugging and a resumable installation, and also provide updater function somehow.

## Structrue
The script keeps its "data" part under `./scriptdata/`, and when it build something from source, they're stored under `./cache/`, which is listed on `.gitignore`.

# Misc tips
The tips below are not very specific for this repo.
They're just for quick notes for developing.

- To git-ignore a file/dir, it should be included in `.gitignore` and **also** `git rm <file/dir>` if `git add` (git-tracked) before.
